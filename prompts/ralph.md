You are invoking the Ralph workflow skill. Use this when the task must continue until fully complete and verified.

Read and follow the full skill instructions at ~/.agents/skills/ralph/SKILL.md

Apply those instructions to the user's argument as the task. Continue persistently until all work is verified and complete.
